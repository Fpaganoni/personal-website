            I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in React and TypeScript,
            passionate about building robust and scalable web solutions. My
            focus is on creating clean, modular, and high-quality code, applying
            best practices at every stage of the development lifecycle.

            <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                I've always been super curious about how tech works. I started
                out building simple websites, but soon found my real passion was
                full-stack developmentâ€”creating robust, real-world solutions.
                That's why I specialize in React and TypeScript; they're the
                tools that help me build things efficiently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working on a bunch of different projects, from freelance gigs to
                a bootcamp team, taught me a lot. I learned that teamwork is
                key, and I got used to working in agile environments. I'm all
                about writing clean, modular code that's easy to scale and
                maintain, and I stick to best practices in everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I'm all about continuous learning and using the best
                tools out there. I see AI as a partner, not a replacement, that
                helps me optimize my workflow so I can focus on the cool,
                complex stuff. My ultimate goal is to team up with people who
                have big ideas to make a real, lasting impact.
